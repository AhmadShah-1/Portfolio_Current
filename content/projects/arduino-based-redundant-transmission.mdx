# Arduino-Based Redundant Transmission for Buoy Networks

## Project Overview
The project implements a resilient communication network for marine buoys, ensuring reliable data transmission despite environmental challenges. Signal transmission in marine environments is often hindered by interference, range limitations, and power constraints. This project leverages redundant transmission methods to enhance reliability.

![Pendulum Design Configuration](/Assets/Projects/Professional/Arduino-Based-Redundant-Transmission-for-Buoy-Networks/Images/3.png)

The system utilizes a pendulum-based energy harvesting mechanism within a protective hemisphere. Key components include an acrylic hemisphere, steel pendulum, and Maxon generator, which work together to convert wave motion into electrical energy.

## Core Features
To ensure robust communication, the system implements:
- **Redundant Data Transmission:** Dual-path communication enhances reliability.
- **Arduino-Based Control System:** Ensures efficient signal processing and relay.
- **Error Correction Techniques:** Data redundancy minimizes transmission losses.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Optimized for extended deployments at sea.
