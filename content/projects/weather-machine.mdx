# Weather Clock: Environmental Data Logger

## Overview
The Weather Clock is a compact, Arduino Nano-based device designed to record, analyze, and display environmental data in real time. The system integrates multiple sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and light intensity, presenting the collected data in both visual (LED-based) and digital formats.
