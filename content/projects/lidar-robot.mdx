# Lidar-Based Autonomous Navigation Robot

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and development of an autonomous robot equipped with LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors and ultrasonic modules to navigate complex terrains while avoiding unforeseen obstacles. The robot efficiently traverses toward assigned coordinates while dynamically adjusting its path to accommodate real-time environmental changes.
