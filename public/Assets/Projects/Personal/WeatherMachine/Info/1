Weather Clock: Environmental Data Logger
Project Overview
The Weather Clock is a compact, Arduino Nano-based device designed to record, analyze, and display environmental data in real time. The system integrates multiple sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and light intensity, presenting the collected data in both visual (LED-based) and digital formats.

With Wi-Fi connectivity, the Weather Clock can transmit recorded data to a remote server for real-time monitoring and analysis, making it suitable for applications such as weather tracking, indoor climate monitoring, and IoT-based automation.

Project Objectives
The main focus of this project was to design a low-power, standalone weather monitoring device capable of:

Accurately recording environmental parameters including temperature, humidity, and light intensity.
Visually displaying temperature using a custom LED encoding system.
Transmitting real-time data to a remote server for further analysis.
Ensuring extended operation time on a single charge, optimizing power efficiency.
Hardware Components
1. Microcontroller & Processing Unit
Arduino Nano – The primary microcontroller, responsible for processing sensor data and managing display functions.
2. Sensors & Data Acquisition
DHT11/DHT22 Sensor – Records temperature and humidity at set intervals.
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) – Measures ambient light intensity.
3. Power Management
Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery – Provides sustained power with an operation time of over 5 days per charge.
Energy-Efficient Circuit Design – Optimized for minimal power consumption to extend battery life.
4. Wireless Communication
ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module – Enables the device to upload data to a remote server for real-time access.
5. LED-Based Temperature Display
RGB LED Indicators – Temperature is encoded using a color-based system, which requires a custom decoder sheet to interpret.
Software & Algorithm Implementation
1. Sensor Data Processing
The DHT11 sensor provides temperature and humidity readings every few seconds.
The LDR sensor detects variations in light intensity, which could be used for daylight monitoring.
The microcontroller processes this data and determines the corresponding LED display color pattern.
2. LED Encoding System
A unique LED color encoding system was designed to display temperature in a non-traditional format.
A decoder sheet is required to interpret the color patterns into numerical values.
3. Wireless Data Transmission
The device connects to a Wi-Fi network and transmits recorded sensor data to an external server.
Logged data is stored and visualized as charts, allowing users to track environmental trends over time.
Testing & Performance Analysis
The Weather Clock underwent extensive testing to evaluate:

Power Efficiency – Successfully operated for over 5 days on a single charge.
Sensor Accuracy – Temperature and humidity readings were validated against calibrated instruments.
Wi-Fi Data Transmission – Successfully uploaded real-time environmental data to a remote server without delays.
LED Visibility – Color-coded temperature indicators were easily distinguishable, ensuring usability.
Challenges & Future Improvements
Challenges Encountered
LED Encoding Complexity – The color-based temperature display required an additional decoder sheet, making it less intuitive for new users.
Wi-Fi Signal Dependency – If Wi-Fi connectivity was unstable, real-time data transmission was delayed.
Power Optimization – Although operational time was over 5 days, further improvements could extend battery life even more.
Proposed Improvements
✅ Upgrade to a More Efficient Temperature Display – Implementing a small OLED screen for a direct numerical readout instead of LED encoding.
✅ Enhance Power Management – Introducing low-power sleep modes for the microcontroller and sensors when idle.
✅ Improve Data Logging & Storage – Adding on-device SD card storage for offline data retention when Wi-Fi is unavailable.

Real-World Applications
The Weather Clock has potential applications in various domains, such as:

Home & Office Climate Monitoring – Real-time tracking of temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions.
IoT-Based Smart Systems – Integration with home automation setups for climate control adjustments.
Agriculture & Greenhouse Monitoring – Helps farmers track microclimate changes to optimize plant health.
Educational Use – A simple yet effective tool to demonstrate environmental data collection.
