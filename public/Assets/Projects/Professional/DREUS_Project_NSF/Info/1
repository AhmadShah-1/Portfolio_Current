DREUS
DREUS is an advanced disaster response framework leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enable autonomous UAV swarms to perform post-disaster surveillance and survivor assistance. The system integrates facial recognition, emotion detection, and federated learning for collaborative swarm intelligence, ensuring efficient navigation and coordination in dynamic and unpredictable disaster environments. This project was a joint effort with the National Sceince Foundation, more information on the official submission can be found on the ICDCS Page, https://easychair.org/conferences2/overview?a=33849257. Our paper submission is attached in the ICDCS_2025_paper_520.pdf.

Key Features:
Surveillance & Assistance: Conducts coordinated surveys, identifies survivors, and prioritizes aid using advanced recognition models. Swarm Collaboration: Shared swarm database prevents redundant UAV visits and centralizes data for efficient tracking. Federated Learning (FL): Enhances decision-making through collaborative training while maintaining data privacy. Training Optimization: Significant Replay Memory Buffer (SRMB) prioritizes critical experiences for faster learning. Realistic Simulations: Survivor behavior modeled on real-world human mobility data ensures reliability. Implementation & Validation: Developed in OpenAI Gym and validated in CoppeliaSim for realistic disaster scenarios. Applications: DREUS is designed to assist in post-disaster scenarios, improving search-and-rescue efforts by efficiently surveying affected areas, identifying survivors, and delivering targeted assistance.
