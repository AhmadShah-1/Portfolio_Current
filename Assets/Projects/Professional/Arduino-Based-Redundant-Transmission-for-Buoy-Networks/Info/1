Arduino-Based Redundant Transmission for Buoy Networks
Overview
This repository contains the implementation and documentation for the Arduino-Based Redundant Transmission for Buoy Networks. The project aims to establish a resilient communication network among marine buoys using redundant transmission techniques to enhance reliability in harsh environments.

Project Objective
Buoy networks play a critical role in oceanographic data collection, weather monitoring, and maritime security. However, signal transmission between buoys and land stations is often unreliable due to environmental interference, range limitations, and power constraints. This project addresses these challenges by implementing:

✅ Redundant Data Transmission – Ensuring robust communication using dual-path transmission.
✅ Arduino-Based Control System – Leveraging low-power microcontrollers to manage signal relaying.
✅ Error Correction Techniques – Enhancing data integrity through redundancy.
✅ Low Power Consumption – Optimizing power efficiency for extended deployments.
System Architecture
🔧 Hardware Components
Arduino Uno – Core microcontroller for processing and communication.
nRF24L01 Radio Module with Passive Amplifier – Wireless communication between buoy nodes.
Custom Energy Production System – Utilizes a pendulum motion to drive a motor for power generation.
Battery Pack – Supplemental energy source for continuous operation.
Sensors (Temperature, Humidity, GPS, etc.) – Environmental data collection and real-time monitoring.
📌 The energy system, as detailed in the project reports, leverages mechanical motion from oceanic movements to generate power, ensuring the buoys remain operational in remote locations.

💻 Software Stack
Arduino IDE – Firmware development.
Python & MATLAB – Data analysis and visualization.
Embedded C – Microcontroller programming.
nRF24L01 Radio Communication Library – Wireless data transmission.
SPI & Wire Libraries – Communication with sensors and external components.

🌐 Network Design
The buoy network operates using a hybrid communication model:

Primary Channel (nRF24L01) – Long-range transmission to the base station.
Error Detection & Resend Mechanism – If data loss is detected, retransmission is triggered via an alternate route.
🚀 Features
