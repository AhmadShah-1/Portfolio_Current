Lidar-Based Autonomous Navigation Robot
Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and development of an autonomous robot equipped with LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors and ultrasonic modules to navigate complex terrains while avoiding unforeseen obstacles. The robot is designed to efficiently traverse toward assigned coordinates while dynamically adjusting its path to accommodate real-time environmental changes.

By integrating sensor fusion, real-time data processing, and efficient path-planning algorithms, the project aims to simulate and improve autonomous navigation capabilities for various real-world applications, including warehouse logistics, search and rescue missions, and autonomous vehicle research.

Project Objectives
The primary goal of the Lidar-Based Autonomous Navigation Robot is to implement a self-sufficient robotic system that can:

Navigate from an initial position to a set of target coordinates while avoiding obstacles.
Detect and classify obstacles in real time using LiDAR and ultrasonic sensors.
Dynamically update its path-planning mechanism based on live data processing.
Maintain stability and balance at increased speeds by optimizing the center of mass.
Transmit positional data to a remote server, allowing external devices to monitor and modify its navigation behavior.
Hardware Components
1. Microcontroller & Processing Unit
Arduino Uno – Acts as the main processing unit, responsible for sensor data acquisition and motor control.
ESP8266 (Optional) – A Wi-Fi module to handle real-time data transmission and cloud-based control.
2. Navigation & Obstacle Detection
360° LiDAR Sensor – Used for long-range scanning and object detection.
Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) – Installed at the front and sides to detect nearby obstacles.
3. Motion System
High-Torque DC Motors – Enables the robot to traverse diverse terrains.
Motor Driver (L298N) – Controls the speed and direction of the motors.
Servo Motors – Used for dynamically adjusting sensor angles to improve coverage.
4. Power Supply
Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery Pack – Provides power to all components.
Software & Algorithm Implementation
1. Path Planning & Obstacle Avoidance
The robot follows a predefined route while continuously scanning for obstacles.
Uses custom path-finding algorithm to compute the optimal path dynamically.
If an obstacle is detected, the robot calculates an alternative path in real time.
2. Sensor Data Processing
The LiDAR sensor provides high-resolution distance measurements, mapping the surrounding environment.
Ultrasonic sensors help detect nearby objects where LiDAR may be less effective.
Data from these sensors is merged to provide a comprehensive view of the environment.
3. Wireless Communication
The robot transmits real-time positional and sensor data to a remote server or monitoring station.
This data can be accessed via a web interface or mobile app, allowing remote observation and manual intervention.
Testing & Performance Analysis
The robot underwent extensive testing in a simulated obstacle course with randomly placed obstacles and assigned targets. The results demonstrated:

Efficient obstacle detection with a response time of ~150ms.
Successful autonomous navigation to multiple destinations, albeit with minor inaccuracies due to sensor limitations.
Challenges & Future Improvements
Challenges Encountered
Blind Spots in Ultrasonic Coverage – The robot had difficulty detecting objects at certain angles.
Delayed Processing in Complex Environments – Navigation became inefficient when multiple obstacles were clustered together.
Proposed Improvements
Increase Sensor Coverage – Adding more ultrasonic sensors to eliminate blind spots and improve responsiveness.
Refine Obstacle Avoidance Logic – Implementing machine learning-based environmental adaptation for smarter path recalculations.
Enhance Energy Efficiency – Further optimizing the device to extend operational time.
